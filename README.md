# ArduinoHelicopter
Code for controlling a Syma S5 IR Helicopter

The BMI160 library is slightly modified, but fits seamlessly into the regular Arduino editor. Just drop the "EmotiBit_BMI160" folder into the Arduino library folder (.../Documents/Arduino/libraries/ by default on Windows).

The program is built so that each variable modifying a control axis is easy to modify so that the responses of the helicopter is easily changed.
